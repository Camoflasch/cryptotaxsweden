# Swedish cryptocurrency tax reporting script

## About

This is a tool to convert your cryptocurrency trade history to the K4 documents needed
for tax reporting to Skatteverket.

Using [cointracking.info](https://cointracking.info?ref=D611015) is currently the
only supported way to import trades. This site does not yet support doing tax
reports using average cost basis which is what is required in Sweden but
it is still very useful for the actual trade data import.

Besides adding support for average cost basis this script can also generate files
which are compatible with Skatteverket. There is either PDF output for printing and
sending by mail or SRU-output which can be imported on skatteverket.se.

## Limitations

The sru format is currently limited in that it doesn't allow
decimals, this is a limitation with skatteverket.se. The
recommendation from Skatteverket is to round to whole numbers
even if that results in 0 BTC or similar being reported.

If the result is a report with a lot of zero amounts of cryptos
reported then you should mention why it looks like this in
"Ã–vriga upplysningar" on the tax report.

## Liability

I'm not taking any responsibility for that this tool will generate a
correct tax report. I am using the tool for my own tax reporting though
so making it correct is a priority to me. You will however have to
take responsibility yourself for the tax report you send to
Skatteverket, this means you should perform a sanity check of some sort
on the generated K4 documents to make sure it looks reasonable.

## Setup

### Windows

There is a packaged version for Windows under releases which can be used.
Change the example command lines below from `python report.py` to
`report.exe` instead if using it.

### macOS

There is a packaged version for macOS under releases which can be used.
Change the example command lines below from `python report.py` to
`./report` instead if using it.

### Other (or if you prefer setting up python yourself)

Python 3.6 is required.

The following python packages are needed for pdf generation.

* pdfrw
* reportlab

Python virtualenv can be setup using

```
virtualenv venv -p python3.6
. ./venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Input data

### data/personal_details.json

This file should have the following format.

```
{
	"namn": "Full name",
	"personnummer": "YYYYMMDD-NNNN",
	"postnummer": "NNNNN",
	"postort": "City"
}
```

### data/trades.csv

To get the data for this file you first need to have your complete trade history
on [cointracking.info](https://cointracking.info?ref=D611015). Then go to the
Trade Prices-page and download a CSV report from that page and store it at
`data/trades.csv`.

The script currently uses a cost basis of 0 for any entries marked as 'Gift/Tip'
on cointracking, this is to be able to report received coins in forks under this
type on cointracking.

### data/stocks.json (optional)

If you have any stock trades which need to be reported in section A on the K4 then you can
enter them in `data/stocks.json`. See `data/stocks_template.json` for the format.

### Example

#### Generate report for 2017 in sru format.

```
python report.py 2017
```

Generated sru files can be found in the ```out``` folder.

Generated sru files can be tested for errors at [https://www.skatteverket.se/filoverforing]

#### Generate report for 2017 in pdf format.

```
python report.py --format=pdf 2017
```

Generated pdf files can be found in the ```out``` folder.

#### Merging the generated pdf files

Merging the pdf files can be done with Ghostscript. It might make printing a bit easier.

```
cd out
gs -q -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -sOutputFile=merged.pdf k4_no*.pdf
```
